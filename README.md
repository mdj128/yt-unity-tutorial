# Unity AI Game Dev Tutorial Series  

This repository contains the Unity project files used in my **YouTube tutorial series** where I build a 3D game step-by-step using Unity and AI-powered tools.

## 🎮 About the Project  
The goal of this series is to show how game development can be accelerated with AI tools — from generating assets, textures, and sounds, to helping with scripts and mechanics.  

By following along, you’ll learn how to:  
- Set up a 3D Unity project from scratch  
- Use AI tools to create characters, animations, and sound effects  
- Add core mechanics: player movement, coin collection, enemies, timers, menus  
- Tie everything into a real **game loop**  

The current build includes:  
- **Player (Gary)** with movement & animations  
- **Collectible coins** (with SFX and UI counter)  
- **Bandit enemies** that chase and steal coins  
- **Timer + Portal objective** (Part 5)  
- **Basic menu system** (Start, Pause, Quit)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This project is for **educational purposes**. It’s not a polished game, but a prototype to demonstrate Unity workflows and AI-assisted development.
